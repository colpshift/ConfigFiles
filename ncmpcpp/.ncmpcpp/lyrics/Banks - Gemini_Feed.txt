[Video version intro:]
And to think you would get me to the altar
Like I'd follow you around like a dog that needs water
But admit it you just wanted me smaller
If you would've let me grow you could've kept my love

Open up your eyes
There's nothing of my body left to see
I tried a thousand times
I tried to say I love you but you didn't hear me
And you're passive aggressive
Convince me other people they don't care about me

You're passive aggressive
You're passive aggressive
You're passive aggressive, hey

And to think you would get me to the altar
Like I'd follow you around like a dog that needs water
But admit it that you wanted me smaller
If you would've let me grow you could've kept my love

Ode to my two thighs
I still want you to kiss em cause they're lonely
And why you so surprised,
That when I said I miss you, you never believed me?
And we were so depressive
You and me together we were gemini feed

And we were so depressive
We were so depressive
We were so depressive, hey

And to think you would get me to the altar
Like I'd follow you around like a dog that needs water
But admit it that you wanted me smaller
If you would've let me grow you could've kept my love

[Vocalizing]

And to think you would get me to the altar
Like I'd follow you around like a dog that needs water
But admit it you just wanted me smaller
If you would've let me grow you could've kept my love

If you think you would get me to the altar
Like I'd follow you around like a dog that needs water
But admit it you just wanted me smaller
If you would've let me grow you could've kept my love
